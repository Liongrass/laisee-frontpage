## ðŸ§§Little red envelopes with money in them: âš¡Lightning Laisee.
What is a Laisee?

Laisee are little red envelopes with money. Lightning Laisee contain Bitcoin on the Lightning Network. They can exist in both physical and digital form. You can send a Lightning Laisee to anyone in the world.

## Built with A statically generated blog example using Next.js and Markdown

This example showcases Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) feature using Markdown files as the data source.

The blog posts are stored in `/_posts` as Markdown files with front matter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.

To create the blog posts we use [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [`remark-html`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html) to convert the Markdown files into an HTML string, and then send it down as a prop to the page. The metadata of every post is handled by [`gray-matter`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and also sent in props to the page.

## Lightning Addresses

Lightning addresses are dynamically added by external script to `public/.well-known/lnurlp` directory

An example address: `user@laisee.org`

**PLEASE BE AWARE THAT ANY CHANGES TO FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY 
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT TG USER ACCOUNTS, 
AS DATA IS NOT SYNCED WITH LNBITS OR POSTGRES**

This blog-starter uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). To control the generated stylesheet's filesize, this example uses Tailwind CSS' v2.0 [`purge` option](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/#removing-unused-css) to remove unused CSS.
